                <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>There's nothing like plain buttermilk pancakes topped with maple syrup. But, if you're in the mood to add something extra to your breakfast, you can! Optional mix-ins include chocolate chips, berries, and nuts. You could also add cinnamon and vanilla to the batter for a little extra warmth. Instead of syrup, you could top your buttermilk pancakes with jam or honey for a sweet twist on a classic.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                    <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
                    <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
                    <li>½ cup milk</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
                    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
                    <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
                    <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
